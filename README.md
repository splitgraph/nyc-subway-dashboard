# Splitgraph + Streamlit

Intended to complement the [blog post](https://splitgraph.com/blog/data-driven-app-powered-by-splitgraph) and illustrate a way to combine Splitgraph's [DDN](https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sql-client-reference/connecting/connect-to-ddn) and querying capabilities with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), to more easily render a dataset in an interactive dashboard, in this case NYC subway turnstiles.
